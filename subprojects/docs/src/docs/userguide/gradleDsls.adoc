== Gradle API and DSLs

INTRO_TBC


=== One API and two DSLs

- implemented in Java, provides a Java API
- allows plugins to be written using any JVM language on top of the Java API
- provides Kotlin and Groovy DSLs for build scripts
- plugins can also be written using Kotlin DSL pre-compiled scripts


=== Kotlin and Groovy

Kotlin the language is statically typed and has null safety built-int.
Groovy on the other hand is highly dynamic by nature.
// TODO add pros for each language


=== Gradle extensible model

TBC


=== The Kotlin DSL

TBC

==== DSL Facilities

* `Action<T>` -> `T.() -> Unit`
* Gradle API extensions
** `Class<T>` -> `KClass<T>`

==== Properties

* Gradle properties
* Project properties
* Extra properties

==== Gradle live collections

* NamedDomainObjectCollection DSL patterns

==== Gradle extensible model

- extensions
- conventions

==== Kotlin language features

TBC


=== The Groovy DSL

TBC

==== DSL Facilities

- `Action<T>` -> `Closure<?>`
- dynamic setters on `Property<T>`

==== Properties

* Gradle properties
* Project properties
* Extra properties

==== Gradle live collections

* NamedDomainObjectCollection DSL patterns

==== Gradle extensible model

- extensions
- conventions

==== Groovy language features

TBC


=== DSLs interoperability
